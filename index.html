            <p>-Pepperoni is a blend of pork, beef, and spices. Its flavor holds its own when paired with Robust Inspired Tomato Sauce and other meats. It’s also delicious with our pizza cheese made with 100 percent real mozzarella cheese. For the best pepperoni pizza.</p>
            <p>-The garlic-enhanced Parmesan white sauce serves as the base for the Cali Bacon Chicken Ranch pizza with premium grilled chicken breast, smoked bacon, tomatoes, and 100 percent real mozzarella and provolone cheeses on a cheesy provolone crust. Garlic elevates the mild grilled chicken, highlights the tangy tomatoes.</p>
            <p>-BBQ Chicken pizza is like summer in a box. To create our Memphis BBQ Chicken pizza, we use only premium grilled chicken , crunchy fresh onions, and not one, not two, but three cheeses: mozzarella, provolone and cheddar on our hand-tossed crust.</p>
            <p>-Alfredo sauce, mainly made from garlic, cheese, and no flour, is used in making this pizza. If you are looking to get a fair amount of calcium and selenium in your system, some good slices of chicken alfredo pizza will do the job.
                In preparing chicken alfredo pizza, boneless chicken breast is used together with mozzarella cheese and alfredo sauce. 
                Therefore, if you are looking for delicious and healthy when it comes to pizza, you should go with chicken alfredo.</p>

For best results, use potatoes that have a high starch content. Russet potatoes, Yukon Gold potatoes, Idaho potatoes and Maris Piper are all good choices to make crispy yet tender french fries.

        <p> -French fries are cut potatoes which are deeply fried. It could be prepared in the home which might differ in the way of making but is regarded to be healthy</p>
        <p> -Seasoning home-cooked French fries with garlic is an easy way to make them more gourmet, and garlic fries are a popular menu item in restaurants too. Most versions toss just-cooked fries with sautéed minced garlic and finely chopped parsley, but you can substitute dried garlic and parsley too. Many versions boost the flavor further by adding Parmesan cheese along with the garlic and parsley.</p>
        <p> -Take cheese fries one step further and add a layer of tasty chili between the fries and cheese. It could be a beef, turkey or vegetarian chili, from a can or homemade. Additional topping options include diced raw onions and hot sauce. You definitely need a fork and a pile of napkins to enjoy this potentially messy treat, which could be a substantial, shareable side dish or a full entrée on its own.</p>
        <p> -Crinkle-cut fries are just like regular fries, usually on the thicker side, but with wavy or crinkly sides and edges. They’re often served in restaurants and you can buy and bake frozen crinkle-cut fries, but it’s also possible to make the real thing at home from scratch. You just need a special crinkle cutter or a crinkle-cutting blade on a mandolin to cut russet-type potatoes into the signature shape. Deep-fry or bake these types of French fries as a fun alternative to regular fries.</p>
